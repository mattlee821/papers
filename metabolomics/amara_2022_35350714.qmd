description: |
  * **Focus**: This review highlights the use of **networks and graph theory** as powerful computational tools for analyzing and interpreting complex metabolomics data.
  * **Network Types**:
      1.  **Analytical/Chemical Networks**: Derived from Mass Spectrometry (MS) data, such as **Molecular Networking (MN)**, which connects spectra based on **chemical structural similarity** to aid in compound identification.
      2.  **Biological/Correlation Networks**: Derived from quantitative metabolite abundance data. These networks use **statistical correlation** between metabolites to infer shared biological regulation, map metabolites onto known **biochemical pathways**, and facilitate **multi-omics integration** (connecting metabolites to genes/proteins).
  * **Implication**: Graph theory enables researchers to move beyond simple lists of metabolites to view the metabolome as a structured, interactive system, which is essential for biological interpretation and hypothesis generation.

## Key Focus: The Application of Graph Theory in Metabolomics

This review article provides a comprehensive overview of how **networks and graph theory** are used as analytical and interpretive tools in metabolomics data analysis. It focuses on the shift from viewing the metabolome as a list of molecules to a structured system of interactions, which is crucial for making biological sense of complex high-throughput data.

### The Role of Graph Theory
In metabolomics, graphs (or networks) are mathematical structures used to represent relationships between two entities:
* **Nodes (Vertices):** Represent the metabolites, genes, proteins, samples, or analytical features (e.g., MS ions).
* **Edges (Links):** Represent the connections or relationships between the nodes, which can be **chemical similarity, biological correlation, co-occurrence, or a known reaction**.

## Network Types and Their Applications

The review categorizes network applications into two main areas based on the type of data they analyze:

### 1. Analytical/Chemical Networks
These networks are derived directly from mass spectrometry (MS) data and are primarily used for **compound identification and annotation**.

* **Molecular Networking (MN):** This is the most prominent example. It connects MS/MS spectra based on the **similarity of their fragmentation patterns**. This allows researchers to group structurally related metabolites (e.g., compounds in the same chemical family) into clusters, enabling the identification of unknown members once one member of the cluster is known

.
* **Feature-Based Molecular Networking (FBMN):** An extension that integrates chromatographic and quantitative data for more robust connections.

### 2. Biological/Correlation Networks
These networks are derived from quantitative abundance data and are primarily used for **biological interpretation and pathway discovery**.

* **Metabolite-Metabolite Correlation Networks:** Nodes are metabolites, and edges represent a **significant statistical correlation** in their concentration changes across different samples or conditions. These correlations can indicate shared regulation, sequential reactions in a metabolic pathway, or common transporters.
* **Metabolite-Pathway Networks:** These map identified metabolites onto **established biochemical pathways** (e.g., KEGG, MetaCyc) to visualize which pathways are perturbed in a given experiment.
* **Integrated Omics Networks:** Graphs are essential for **multi-omics integration**, connecting metabolites to other molecular entities like transcripts (mRNA) and proteins. The edges often represent genetic co-expression, shared regulation, or enzyme-substrate relationships.

## Key Advantages

The application of graph theory offers significant advantages for metabolomics:
* **Discovery of Hidden Relationships:** Networks can reveal complex, non-linear relationships that are missed by traditional univariate statistics.
* **Hypothesis Generation:** Network hubs (highly connected nodes) often represent key regulatory or rate-limiting enzymes and metabolites, pointing to critical biological control points.
* **Visualization:** They provide an intuitive and powerful way to visualize and communicate complex, high-dimensional data.

## Conclusion

The review concludes that network and graph-based approaches are fundamental to modern metabolomics, bridging the gap between raw analytical data and comprehensive biological understanding. They are crucial for moving the field forward, especially in the context of integrating data from multiple omics layers.
