title: "Characterization of missing values in untargeted MS-based metabolomics data and evaluation of missing data handling strategies"
description: |
  * **Objective**: The study systematically characterized the sources of **missing values (MVs)** in untargeted Mass Spectrometry (MS)-based metabolomics data and evaluated various imputation strategies.
  * **Missing Value Types**: Distinguished between **systematic missingness** primarily due to **Limits of Detection (LOD)** and **random missingness** due to technical issues.
  * **Best Strategy**: For the prevalent LOD-related MVs, which represent concentrations near zero, simple methods like **imputation with half of the minimum observed value** were found to be effective and often outperformed complex data-driven methods (e.g., PPCA).
  * **Recommendation**: Researchers should use targeted imputation strategies based on the **nature of the missingness** to avoid introducing bias and reducing statistical power.

## Key Focus: The Problem of Missing Values in Untargeted Metabolomics

This study provides a systematic characterization of **missing values (MVs)** in untargeted mass spectrometry (MS)-based metabolomics data and evaluates various strategies for handling these MVs. Missing data is a common issue that can severely **reduce statistical power and introduce bias** in downstream biomedical studies.

### Characterization of Missing Values
The study distinguished two primary types of MVs based on their origin:

1.  **Missing Due to Limits of Detection (LOD):** This is the most prevalent form and is often **systematic**. It occurs when a compound's concentration is below the instrument's detection threshold. This systematic pattern can be further influenced by **run day-dependent effects** (e.g., changes in instrument performance over time).
2.  **Missing at Random (MAR) or Completely at Random (MCAR):** These MVs occur less frequently and are typically a consequence of random technical errors during **sample preparation** or measurement (e.g., ionization suppression, inconsistent retention time).

### Evaluation of Imputation Strategies
The study evaluated several common imputation strategies, including:

* **Fixed-Value Imputation:** Replacing MVs with a fixed constant, such as zero, the mean, or a value derived from the **limit of detection (LOD)** (e.g., half the minimum detected value).
* **Data-Driven Imputation:** Using statistical or machine learning methods based on the observed data, such as **Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis (PPCA)** or **$k$-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)**.

### Best Performing Strategy
The key finding regarding MV handling was that the best strategy depends on the **nature of the missingness**:

* **For LOD-related MVs (Systematic Missingness):** Simple methods like **half-of-the-minimum-observed-value imputation** performed surprisingly well and often outperformed more complex data-driven methods. This is because LOD-MVs are not truly random but represent a biological value that is near zero.
* **For MAR/MCAR MVs (Random Missingness):** Data-driven methods like **PPCA** and **kNN** generally performed better than fixed-value methods. However, given that LOD-MVs dominate untargeted metabolomics, the overall benefit of complex methods was limited.

## Conclusions and Recommendations

The study emphasizes that the high proportion of systematic, **LOD-related missingness** is a characteristic feature of untargeted MS-based metabolomics.

Researchers should:
1.  **Characterize Missingness:** Visually inspect data to distinguish systematic LOD-MVs from random MVs.
2.  **Apply Targeted Imputation:** For the high number of LOD-MVs, use a simple, robust method like **imputation with a small value (e.g., half the minimum)**.
3.  **Future Development:** The authors call for the development of new, tailored imputation methods that can explicitly and simultaneously model both the **systematic (LOD)** and **random (MAR/MCAR)** components of missingness in metabolomics data.
