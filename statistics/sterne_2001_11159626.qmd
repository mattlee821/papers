title: "Sifting the evidence—what's wrong with significance tests?"
description: |
  * **Core Critique**: This classic commentary criticizes the widespread misuse and over-reliance on **statistical significance tests (p-values)** in medical literature, arguing that this practice fundamentally distorts evidence.
  * **Central Problem**: The authors identify **publication bias** (accentuating positive results over null results) as the key factor causing the mistaken publication of **chance findings** as real effects, thereby eroding confidence in science.
  * **Recommendation**: Researchers should shift their focus from the binary question of whether P < 0.05 to assessing the **direction** and the **magnitude** of the effect, specifically asking if the effect is of **public health or clinical importance**.

## Key Findings: The Misuse and Limitations of Statistical Significance

This highly influential article critiques the over-reliance on **statistical significance testing** (p-values) in medical and epidemiological research, arguing that this practice fundamentally distorts the scientific literature and leads to public skepticism.

### The Central Problem: Publication Bias

The primary issue is the medical literature's strong tendency to accentuate the positive, leading to **publication bias** (also known as the "file drawer effect"):

1.  **Skewed Reporting**: Studies with **positive outcomes** (those achieving statistical significance, typically P<0.05) are far more likely to be published than those with **null results** (non-significant findings).
2.  **Increased Chance Findings**: This creates a system where a host of purely **chance findings** are published and subsequently mistaken for real biological or clinical effects. The authors note that, by conventional reasoning, examining 20 associations will produce one "significant at P=0.05" result by chance alone.
3.  **Erosion of Trust**: The proliferation of inconsistent, purely chance findings contributes significantly to **scepticism** about medical research and epidemiological studies among the public and practitioners.

### Shifting Focus: From P-value to Effect Magnitude

The authors argue that focusing solely on whether a P-value crosses the 0.05 threshold misses the point of much medical research, particularly in observational and interventional studies:

* **Null Hypothesis Relevance**: In many epidemiological studies and randomized controlled trials, there is often little reason to expect the true effect to be exactly null. The key issue is not consistency with a strict null hypothesis.
* **The Real Questions**: Instead of asking *if* an effect exists (P-value), researchers should focus on:
    * Whether the **direction** of the effect has been reasonably and firmly established.
    * Whether the **magnitude** of the effect is such that it is of **public health or clinical importance**. A small, statistically significant effect may be clinically irrelevant. A large, non-significant effect may warrant further study.

### Historical Context

The critique is contextualized by referencing the founder of statistical significance testing, **Ronald Fisher**, and the early criticism he received from his colleague F. Yates, who noted that Fisher's emphasis on significance testing was problematic. The paper implicitly advocates for the use of **Confidence Intervals (CIs)**, which convey both the direction and the magnitude of the effect along with the precision of the estimate.
