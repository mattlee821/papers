title: "Comparison of Imputation Strategies for Incomplete Longitudinal Data in Life-Course Epidemiology"
description: |
  * **Topic**: A study comparing the performance of three **Multiple Imputation (MI)** methods for handling **incomplete longitudinal data** in life-course epidemiology, focusing on the effect of longitudinal depressive symptoms on mortality.
  * **Methods Compared**: **Normal Linear Regression (MICE)**, **Predictive Mean Matching (PMM)**, and **Variable-Tailored Specification** were tested under nine scenarios varying missingness rate and mechanism (MCAR, MAR, MNAR).
  * **Finding**: All methods showed similar levels of **bias** in estimating the causal effect (Hazard Ratios), but **Predictive Mean Matching (PMM)** was identified as the most appealing strategy due to its consistently **low root mean square error (RMSE)** and competitive computation time.

## Background and Objective

**Incomplete longitudinal data**—data with values missing at different time points for the same individuals—is a pervasive challenge in life-course epidemiology. If not handled correctly, this missingness can introduce **bias** and lead to incorrect statistical inference. **Multiple imputation (MI)** is the increasingly preferred method for addressing this, but real-world performance comparisons between different MI techniques are limited.

The objective of this study was to conduct a **direct comparison of three Multiple Imputation (MI) methods** using real-world longitudinal data to assess their performance, feasibility, and impact on causal effect estimates across various missing-data scenarios.

## Methods: Benchmarking on HRS Data

The researchers compared three Multiple Imputation (MI) methods using data from the **Health and Retirement Study (HRS)**:

1.  **Normal Linear Regression** (Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations - MICE)
2.  **Predictive Mean Matching (PMM)** (a non-parametric MICE method)
3.  **Variable-Tailored Specification**

The comparison was conducted under **nine missing-data scenarios** that represented combinations of:
* **Missingness Rate:** 10%, 20%, and 30% missingness.
* **Missingness Mechanism:** Missing Completely at Random (**MCAR**), Missing at Random (**MAR**), and Missing Not at Random (**MNAR**).

The study introduced record-level missingness to a complete sample of HRS participants and then used the imputed datasets to fit **Cox proportional hazards models**. The outcome of interest was the effect of four different operationalizations of longitudinal depressive symptoms on subsequent mortality.

## Key Results and Conclusion

The comparison focused on three performance metrics: **bias** in hazard ratios, **root mean square error (RMSE)**, and **computation time**.

* **Bias:** Bias in the estimated hazard ratios was found to be **similar across all three MI methods**.
* **Consistency:** The results were consistent across the four different ways the longitudinal exposure (depressive symptoms) was defined.
* **Performance:** The authors suggest that **Predictive Mean Matching (PMM)** may be the most appealing strategy for imputing life-course exposure data. PMM consistently showed the **lowest root mean square error (RMSE)**—indicating greater precision—and maintained **competitive computation times** with few implementation challenges.

This study provides valuable, empirically-based guidance for researchers in life-course epidemiology regarding the choice of MI method for handling incomplete longitudinal exposure data.
