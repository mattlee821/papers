title: "The cost of dichotomising continuous variables"
description: |
  * **Avoidable Costs**: The practice of dichotomizing continuous variables for statistical analysis leads to a substantial **loss of statistical power** and an **inflation of the Type I error rate** (false positives) in multivariable models.
  * **Flawed Interpretation**: Dichotomization uses arbitrary or unstable cut-points, provides **misleading effect estimates**, and ignores the true shape of the relationship across the continuous scale.
  * **Recommendation**: Continuous variables should be analyzed on their **original scale** (or using methods like fractional polynomials/splines) to preserve information and avoid these serious statistical drawbacks.

## Key Finding: Dichotomization of Continuous Variables is Statistically Detrimental

This article critiques the common practice in clinical research of converting **continuous variables** (e.g., blood pressure, weight, cholesterol) into **binary categories** (**dichotomization**, e.g., "hypertensive" or "not hypertensive"). The authors argue that while this practice is useful for clinical decision-making and data presentation, it is **unnecessary for statistical analysis** and introduces several serious, avoidable drawbacks.

## Study Design and Methods

This paper is a **Statistics Note** (a commentary/review) that uses theoretical arguments and a review of existing statistical literature to demonstrate the flaws of dichotomization.

The core argument is based on quantifying the statistical and inferential costs associated with replacing precise continuous data with a simple binary indicator (0 or 1). The analysis focuses on the detrimental impact on **statistical power** and **Type I error control** in subsequent analyses, particularly in regression modeling.

## Results and Major Drawbacks

The authors identify four main statistical costs associated with dichotomization:

### 1. Substantial Loss of Statistical Power
The primary statistical consequence is a **reduction in power** to detect a true association or effect. By converting a continuous measure into a binary one, researchers discard a significant amount of information (i.e., the magnitude of a value relative to others). This loss of information is equivalent to conducting a study with a **much smaller sample size**, making it harder to achieve statistical significance for a genuine effect.

### 2. Inflation of the Type I Error Rate
When a **confounding variable** is dichotomized in a multivariable model (e.g., logistic regression), it often fails to adequately control for the confounding effect across the full range of the variable. This **residual confounding** can lead to a substantial **inflation of the Type I error rate** for other variables in the model, increasing the risk of **false-positive findings**.

### 3. Arbitrary and Unstable Cut-points
The choice of the **cut-point** used to divide the continuous variable is frequently **arbitrary** and lacks strong biological justification. Furthermore, attempts to find an "optimal" cut-point based on the observed data are statistically dangerous, as this practice can lead to **biased effect estimates** (overestimation) and a **loss of validity** when generalizing results to new data.

### 4. Misleading Effect Estimates
Dichotomization assumes a simple step-function relationship between the variable and the outcome. This ignores the detailed variation within each group and can entirely **misrepresent a true biological relationship**, especially if that relationship is **non-linear** across the continuous scale. The resulting effect estimate only represents the difference between the mean values of the two resulting groups, masking the true dose-response curve.

## Conclusion and Recommendations

The authors conclude that dichotomization sacrifices statistical rigor for an unnecessary simplicity in the analysis stage.

They strongly recommend that continuous variables should be analyzed on their **original continuous scale** in statistical models (e.g., as continuous predictors in regression models). If the relationship is suspected to be non-linear, more appropriate methods such as **fractional polynomials** or **splines** should be used instead of categorization.
