title: "Genome-wide risk prediction of common diseases across ancestries in one million people"
description: |
  * This large-scale study evaluated the cross-ancestry transferability of **Polygenic Risk Scores (PRSs)** for four common diseases (CAD, T2D, breast, and prostate cancer) using data from six biobanks and over one million individuals of diverse global ancestries.
  * The analysis found that PRS transferability was **high and robust** across different populations and substructures of European ancestry, but was significantly **lower for individuals of African, South Asian, and East Asian ancestry**.
  * The poor transferability, which was most pronounced in African ancestry individuals, highlights the critical issue of **ancestral bias** in genomic research and the potential for current PRS implementation to exacerbate **health disparities** until more diverse training data are available.

## Key Findings

This study performed a large-scale, cross-ancestry evaluation of **Polygenic Risk Scores (PRSs)** for four major common diseases—Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), Breast Cancer, and Prostate Cancer—using genome-wide genotype data from six biobanks across Europe, the United States, and Asia, encompassing over one million individuals. The principal finding is a striking disparity in PRS transferability and accuracy: the predictive ability of PRSs remains robust and highly similar across various **European populations** and local population substructures, suggesting utility in clinical settings for this group. However, the PRSs exhibited significantly **poorer transferability** and substantially **lower effect sizes** in individuals of **African ancestry**, and to a lesser extent, in South Asian and East Asian ancestries. This large-scale empirical evidence underscores the immediate challenge of ancestral bias in genomic data and highlights the potential for the clinical implementation of current PRSs to exacerbate existing health disparities.

## Study Design and Data

The study utilized a combined dataset of approximately **one million individuals** across six major biobanks: BioBank Japan, Estonian Biobank, FinnGen, HUNT, Mass General Brigham (MGB) Biobank, and UK Biobank. The ancestries evaluated included European, South Asian, East Asian, and African.

### PRS Calculation and Evaluation

* **PRS Method**: Genome-wide PRSs were calculated using **LDpred**, a method that accounts for linkage disequilibrium (LD) and uses a Bayesian approach to estimate SNP effect sizes, incorporating over 6 million variants for each disease.
* **Input Data**: The input weights were obtained from the largest publicly available, non-overlapping **Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWASs)** for each of the four diseases.
* **Transferability Assessment**: Transferability was assessed by comparing the **Odds Ratios (OR)** per standard deviation (SD) increase in PRS across different global ancestry groups, and also within European populations (including a population isolate, Finland).

## Key Results on Transferability

### Global Ancestry Disparities

A clear gradient of PRS accuracy was observed, directly correlated with the genetic distance from the primary European GWAS training cohorts:

* **European Ancestry**: The PRSs showed consistently **high and similar effect sizes (ORs)** across various European populations and health-care systems, suggesting good utility for risk stratification.
* **Asian Ancestry**: Individuals of South Asian and East Asian ancestry exhibited similar or slightly lower effect sizes compared to Europeans.
* **African Ancestry**: Individuals of African ancestry consistently had the **lowest effect sizes and poorest prediction accuracy** for all four diseases. For instance, in breast cancer, the association was not statistically significant in women of African ancestry in some cohorts.

### Substructure and Polygenicity

* **Within-European Transferability**: The PRSs transferred well even between highly structured European populations, such as various regional substructures within Finland, demonstrating robustness across recent population bottlenecks.
* **Genome-wide vs. Sparse PRS**: A crucial methodological finding was that the highly **polygenic, genome-wide PRSs** (using millions of variants) displayed **higher effect sizes and better transferability** across global ancestries than PRSs containing only a smaller, more stringently selected set of variants (sparse PRSs). This supports the notion that the polygenic nature of these traits is captured across different populations, even if the fine-mapping of causal variants differs.

## Implications for Clinical Utility

The findings provide strong evidence that the current state of **PRS technology** is not ready for equitable clinical deployment:

* **Clinical Utility**: Current PRSs have demonstrated significant potential for clinical screening and prevention in individuals of **European ancestry**.
* **Health Equity Concern**: The low predictive accuracy in individuals of African ancestry, South Asian, and East Asian ancestry—stemming from the lack of diversity in the original GWAS training data—poses a significant challenge to global health equity and personalized medicine. The study stresses the urgent necessity of investing in and executing large-scale GWAS in non-European populations to address this bias.
