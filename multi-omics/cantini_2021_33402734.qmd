## Background and Objective

High-dimensional multi-omics data is now standard for understanding complex biological systems like cancer. **Joint Dimensionality Reduction (jDR)** methods are crucial for the effective **integration** of these heterogeneous datasets. However, the large number of available jDR methods necessitates a systematic evaluation to provide researchers with reliable guidance on which method to choose for their specific research question.

This paper presents a **comprehensive benchmark** of nine representative joint multi-omics dimensionality reduction approaches to offer **practical guidelines** for their application, particularly in the study of cancer.

## Methods: Systematic Evaluation

The study systematically evaluated **nine representative jDR methods** (including MCIA, iCluster, and intNMF) across three complementary benchmark scenarios:

1.  **Ground-Truth Clustering:** Assessing the methods' ability to retrieve known **sample clustering** patterns from **simulated multi-omics datasets**.
2.  **Clinical Relevance (TCGA):** Using **The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cancer data** to evaluate how well the methods' reduced dimensions predict **patient survival**, **clinical annotations**, and enrich for known **pathways/biological processes**.
3.  **Single-Cell Classification:** Assessing performance in the classification of multi-omics **single-cell data**. 

The authors also created a reproducible code platform named **momix (multi-omics mix)**, implementing the code developed for this benchmark to support users and future comparative studies.

## Key Results and Conclusions

The in-depth comparisons provided clear performance distinctions among the nine methods:

* **Best Clustering Performer:** The **intNMF** (integrated Non-negative Matrix Factorization) method demonstrated the best performance in retrieving ground-truth clustering from simulated data.
* **Best All-Rounder:** **MCIA (Multiple Co-Inertia Analysis)** offered effective and consistent behavior across many different contexts and benchmark criteria, suggesting it is a robust general-purpose tool for integration.
* **Significance:** The benchmarking study is a critical resource for the multi-omics community, offering **data-driven recommendations** for selecting appropriate jDR tools based on the specific research question (e.g., whether the goal is clustering or prediction).
