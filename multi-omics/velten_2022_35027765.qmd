  * **Method**: **MEFISTO** (Multi-omics Factor Analysis Informed by Spatial and Temporal Omics) is an extension of MOFA that uses **Gaussian Process (GP) priors** on latent factors to model **spatial or temporal dependencies** between samples.
  * **Key Capabilities**: It performs **spatio-temporally informed dimensionality reduction**, allowing factors to change **smoothly** over time/space. It also enables robust **interpolation** of data for unobserved locations or time points.
  * **Application**: MEFISTO successfully analyzed data from **spatial transcriptomics**, **longitudinal microbiome studies**, and **single-cell multi-omics atlases** to align and extract common developmental or temporal patterns.

## Background and Objective

Factor analysis, as implemented in tools like MOFA (Multi-Omics Factor Analysis), is widely used for **dimensionality reduction** and multi-omics integration. However, these models traditionally assume that samples are **independent** of one another. This assumption fails in modern high-resolution biological studies that profile molecular data with **temporal** (time-series) or **spatial** dependencies (e.g., spatial transcriptomics, longitudinal cohorts, developmental atlases).

This paper introduces **MEFISTO (Multi-omics Factor Analysis Informed by Spatial and Temporal Omics)**, an extension of the MOFA framework, designed to:
1.  Perform factor analysis while explicitly accounting for **spatial or temporal dependencies** between samples.
2.  Perform **spatio-temporally informed dimensionality reduction** and **imputation** on high-dimensional multi-omics data.
3.  **Separate smooth** (e.g., developmental trajectory) from **non-smooth** (e.g., technical noise) patterns of variation.

## Methods: The MEFISTO Framework

### Core Algorithm and Innovation
MEFISTO maintains the core **latent factor model** of MOFA, where data from different omics layers is modeled as a linear combination of shared latent factors. The key innovation is how it models these latent factors:

* **Spatio-Temporal Prior:** MEFISTO incorporates a **Gaussian Process (GP) prior** on the factor values. This GP prior allows the factors to be **smooth functions** of the observed spatial or temporal coordinates (i.e., time points, spatial locations).
* **Modeling Dependencies:** By using the GP prior, MEFISTO learns latent factors that are constrained to change **gradually** over space or time, which aligns with biological reality (e.g., developmental progression, cellular diffusion). Factors not relevant to the spatial/temporal axes are modeled with a non-smooth prior.
* **Joint Integration:** Like MOFA, MEFISTO can integrate data from multiple omics modalities measured on the same samples and simultaneously identify shared and modality-specific sources of variation.

### Applications
MEFISTO was validated across diverse datasets with structured dependencies:
1.  **Spatial Transcriptomics:** Applied to mouse organ data to reconstruct the spatial organization of gene expression.
2.  **Longitudinal Microbiome Study:** Used to capture smooth temporal changes in the gut microbiome.
3.  **Single-Cell Multi-Omics:** Applied to a mouse gastrulation atlas to align complex single-cell transcriptomic and epigenetic data along a developmental **pseudotime** axis.

## Key Results and Capabilities

### Informed Dimensionality Reduction
In all applications, MEFISTO successfully found **latent factors** that were biologically relevant and showed a smooth progression across the given time points or spatial coordinates.

### Interpolation and Imputation
The GP prior allows MEFISTO to perform robust **interpolation**—predicting factor values and corresponding omics data for **unobserved time points or spatial locations**. This is crucial for filling gaps in time-series experiments.

### Data Alignment
MEFISTO's ability to identify underlying common factors makes it excellent for **aligning multiple related datasets**. For instance, it can align single-cell data from different samples or studies onto a common developmental trajectory, identifying the shared underlying factors of biological variation.

## Conclusions and Significance

**MEFISTO** is a versatile and essential tool for the analysis of modern biological data that contains **temporal or spatial structure**. By incorporating Gaussian Process priors into the factor analysis framework, it overcomes the independence assumption of classical methods.

MEFISTO’s capabilities in **spatio-temporally informed dimensionality reduction, interpolation, and multi-dataset alignment** make it a powerful method for extracting meaningful, smooth biological patterns from complex single-cell and multi-omics atlases.
