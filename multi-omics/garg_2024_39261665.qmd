description: |
  * **Method**: **MILTON (Machine Learning with Phenotype Associations)**, an ensemble machine-learning framework, was developed to integrate multi-omics (including plasma proteomics) and biomarker data from the UK Biobank to predict disease risk.
  * **Objective**: To demonstrate how these biomarker-based predictions can **augment genetic association analyses** in a phenome-wide context.
  * **Impact**: MILTON **outperformed Polygenic Risk Scores (PRSs)** in predicting incident disease. Its application in a PheWAS **improved signals for 88 known and 14 novel genetic associations**, showing its utility in empowering genetic discovery for complex diseases by improving disease classification.

## Background and Objective

Biobank-level datasets, such as the UK Biobank, offer unprecedented opportunities to discover novel **biomarkers** and develop powerful predictive algorithms for human disease. The challenge lies in effectively integrating diverse, multi-level data (genomics, proteomics, clinical records) to simultaneously improve disease prediction and the statistical power of **genetic discovery**.

This study introduces **MILTON (Machine Learning with Phenotype Associations)**, an **ensemble machine-learning framework** designed to predict a wide range of diseases using multi-omics and clinical biomarkers. The main objective is to demonstrate how these accurate, biomarker-based predictions can **augment case-control genetic association studies**.

## Methods: The MILTON Framework

MILTON is an **ensemble machine-learning framework** that integrates diverse data types to predict disease status.

1.  **Data Integration:** The framework was developed using the UK Biobank, integrating matched **plasma proteomics data** (from 46,327 samples) and other biomarkers with genetic data (from 484,230 genome-sequenced samples).
2.  **Prediction Task:** MILTON was trained to predict **3,213 incident disease cases**—cases that were undiagnosed at the time of recruitment—by leveraging the UK Biobank’s **longitudinal health record data**.
3.  **Augmenting Genetics:** The highly accurate disease predictions from MILTON were then used to refine the case and control definitions in a **phenome-wide association study (PheWAS)**. By improving disease classification through biomarker-based prediction, MILTON effectively enhances the statistical power of the genetic association analyses. 

## Key Results and Significance

MILTON demonstrated substantial efficacy in both prediction and genetic discovery:

* **Superior Prediction:** MILTON significantly **outperformed available polygenic risk scores (PRSs)** in predicting incident disease cases, especially for diseases with strong molecular links.
* **Empowered Genetic Discovery:** When applied to the PheWAS, the framework successfully augmented genetic association analyses. This resulted in **improved signals for 88 known genetic associations** and led to the discovery of **14 novel genetic associations**.
* **Targeted Improvement:** The framework showed the largest improvement in genetic discovery for diseases characterized by **lower PRS prediction accuracy** but **higher biomarker prediction accuracy**.

## Conclusion

The MILTON framework provides a powerful and practical approach to leverage deep molecular phenotyping, including multi-omics data, for **disease prediction**. Crucially, it demonstrates a successful strategy to **empower case-control genetic discoveries** by refining disease classification, which will accelerate the understanding of the underlying mechanisms of human diseases.
