## Background and Objective

The heterogeneity of cancers, driven by complex alterations across multiple molecular levels (genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics), necessitates advanced statistical methods. Identifying **robust molecular subtypes** of cancer is a crucial step for **personalized medicine**. Traditional clustering methods applied to single omics layers often yield unstable results.

This paper provides an **overview and practical guide** to **integrative clustering**—an unsupervised learning approach that uses multi-omics data to simultaneously identify shared disease subtypes and their associated molecular signatures. The chapter primarily focuses on **model-based statistical approaches**.

## Methods: Integrative Clustering Taxonomy

The chapter classifies and describes the prominent statistical methods used for integrative clustering of multi-omics data:

### 1. Model-Based Approaches
These methods assume that the variation across different omics datasets can be explained by a set of **shared, hidden (latent) variables** or factors.

* **iCluster (Integrative Clustering):** A latent variable model that uses a **joint likelihood function** to integrate multiple omics data types. It incorporates **penalized regression** to enforce **sparsity** and perform feature selection, identifying the key molecular features that define the clusters.
* **iClusterPlus (Bayesian Extensions):** Enhancements that use **Bayesian methods** and **Dirichlet process priors** to improve robustness, handle diverse data distributions (e.g., count, binary), and automatically estimate the optimal number of clusters ($K$).

### 2. Nonparametric Approaches
These methods do not rely on specific distributional assumptions.

* **Similarity Network Fusion (SNF):** This method constructs a **similarity network** for each individual omics dataset, then iteratively **fuses** them into a single, comprehensive patient similarity network, which is then clustered to define the final disease subtypes. 

## Conclusions and Significance

Integrative clustering is essential for analyzing heterogeneous multi-omics data. By combining information across multiple molecular layers, these methods produce **stable and biologically meaningful disease subtypes** and their corresponding **molecular signatures**. The guide provides the necessary foundation and practical steps for researchers to apply these techniques in cancer biology and precision medicine, including **data preprocessing**, **model selection**, and **biological interpretation** (e.g., using **Kaplan-Meier curves** to assess survival differences between subtypes).
