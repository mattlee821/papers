title: "The contribution of genetic determinants of blood gene expression and splicing to molecular phenotypes and health outcomes"
description: |
  * **Topic**: Investigating the **gene-regulatory mechanisms** (eQTLs and sQTLs) of nonprotein-coding genetic variants in blood and their causal contribution to **3,430 molecular phenotypes** (proteins, metabolites, lipids) and health outcomes.
  * **Method**: Mapped eQTLs and sQTLs in 4,732 individuals and used **colocalization** and **mediation analyses** to link these regulatory variants to downstream molecular and disease traits.
  * **Impact**: Identified 222 molecular phenotypes significantly **mediated by gene expression or splicing**, providing mechanistic insights into diseases (e.g., $WARS1$ in hypertension) and offering a valuable public resource for human genetic etiology.

## Background and Objective

The biological mechanisms through which the majority of **nonprotein-coding genetic variants** influence disease risk remain largely unknown. These variants often function by regulating gene activity. The objective of this study was to comprehensively investigate these **gene-regulatory mechanisms** by mapping genetic determinants of gene expression and splicing in blood and integrating them with various molecular and health outcomes.

## Methods: Multi-Omics QTL Mapping and Integration

The researchers conducted a comprehensive multi-omics study using data from 4,732 participants to identify **quantitative trait loci (QTLs)**:

1.  **QTL Mapping:** They mapped **gene expression QTLs (eQTLs)** and **splicing QTLs (sQTLs)** in blood using bulk RNA sequencing, identifying **cis-QTLs** for 17,233 genes and 29,514 splicing events.
2.  **Multi-omics Integration:** They integrated the identified genetic associations with data on **protein, metabolite, and lipid** levels from the same individuals.
3.  **Causal Inference:** They employed **colocalization analyses** to pinpoint instances where the same causal genetic variant affects both a transcriptional/splicing phenotype and a molecular/health outcome. 
4.  **Mediation Analysis:** They quantified the relative contribution of genetic effects at loci with shared etiology to determine which molecular phenotypes are significantly **mediated by gene expression or splicing**.

## Key Results and Significance

The study successfully bridged the gap between genetic variation and downstream molecular and clinical phenotypes:

* **Extensive Shared Genetic Etiology:** Colocalization analyses revealed a shared genetic association signal with gene expression or splicing for **3,430 proteomic and metabolomic traits**.
* **Mediated Molecular Phenotypes:** They found that **222 molecular phenotypes** were significantly mediated by gene expression or splicing, providing strong evidence for gene-regulatory causality.
* **Mechanistic Insights:** The approach uncovered specific gene-regulatory mechanisms at disease loci with potential therapeutic relevance, such as **$WARS1$ in hypertension**, **$IL7R$ in dermatitis**, and **$IFNAR2$ in COVID-19$.**
* **Public Resource:** The findings provide a comprehensive, open-access resource on the shared genetic etiology across transcriptional phenotypes, molecular traits, and health outcomes (`https://IntervalRNA.org.uk`).
