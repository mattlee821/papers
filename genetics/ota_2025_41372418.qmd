title: "Causal modelling of gene effects from regulators to programs to traits"
description: |
  * **Framework:** This paper proposes a novel statistical approach to infer **causal mechanistic pathways** that link genes to traits by combining gene-trait effect sizes (from GWAS LoF burden tests) with gene-regulatory relationships (from Perturb-seq experiments).
  * **Causal Hierarchy:** The model establishes a **three-step causal graph**: Gene $\longrightarrow$ Regulatory Programs $\longrightarrow$ Trait, allowing researchers to explain gene-trait associations via intermediate functional steps.
  * **Proof of Concept:** Applied to three blood traits (RDW, MCH, IRF) using human HSPC Perturb-seq data, the model successfully identified the regulatory programs (e.g., ribosomal genes) and directionally predicted how gene perturbations causally influence the traits.

## Research Goal and Causal Framework

This paper addresses a critical gap in human genetics: the lack of genome-scale approaches to infer **causal mechanistic pathways** linking genes to cellular functions and ultimately to complex human traits. The authors propose a novel framework that bridges this gap by combining quantitative genetic association data with regulatory information from cellular perturbation experiments.

### The Proposed Causal Model

The core of the study is the construction of a **causal graph** that models the directional associations of genes with a trait. The model posits a three-step causal hierarchy:

$$ \text{Gene} \longrightarrow \text{Regulatory Programs} \longrightarrow \text{Trait} $$

The approach uses two main data inputs:
1.  **Gene-Trait Relationships ($\gamma$):** Quantitative estimates of gene effects on traits, derived from **Loss-of-Function (LoF) burden tests** in large-scale genetic studies (GWAS).
2.  **Gene-Regulatory Relationships ($\beta$):** Quantitative estimates of a gene's regulatory effects on cellular programs, inferred from high-throughput cellular perturbation assays, such as **Perturb-seq** experiments in relevant cell types.

The model combines these two forms of data using a statistical framework to infer the causal path, allowing gene-trait associations to be explained by regulatory effects on intermediate biological programs or by direct effects on the trait.

## Proof of Concept: Blood Trait Analysis

The authors applied this causal framework as a proof of concept to jointly model three partially co-regulated blood traits: **Red Blood Cell Distribution Width (RDW), Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin (MCH), and Immature Reticulocyte Fraction (IRF)**.

### Methods and Data Integration

1.  **Perturb-seq Data:** Used pooled Perturb-seq experiments (CRISPR-based perturbation combined with single-cell RNA sequencing) in human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), which are the trait-relevant cell type, to generate a comprehensive map of gene-regulatory connections ($\beta$).
2.  **GWAS Data:** Used publicly available GWAS data to calculate gene-level effect sizes ($\gamma$) for LoF burden on the three blood traits.
3.  **Causal Graph Construction:** The combined data were used to construct a causal graph of the gene-regulatory hierarchy underlying the traits.

### Key Results

* **Identifying Regulatory Programs:** The model successfully identified **regulatory programs** (groups of co-regulated genes) that serve as intermediate causal steps. For instance, the model identified a program involving ribosomal genes that causally links gene perturbations to RDW and MCH.
* **Directional Causality:** The framework was able to determine the directional relationships, showing how the perturbation of a regulatory gene affects a specific program, which in turn affects the trait.
* **Novel Gene-Trait Links:** The model provided functional validation for known associations and suggested new mechanisms. For example, the regulatory effect of $GATA1$ perturbation on multiple programs was successfully linked to observed effects on all three blood traits.
* **Cross-Trait Comparisons:** The model was used to predict cross-trait relationships of gene effects, showing how a gene's regulatory effect can lead to correlated or inversely correlated outcomes across different traits.

## Conclusions and Future Directions

The study demonstrates a novel and powerful strategy for leveraging cellular perturbation screens in conjunction with human genetic data to move beyond simple association and systematically infer the **mechanistic chain of causality** from genes to biological programs to complex traits.

The approach is scalable and suggests that performing Perturb-seq experiments in additional trait-relevant cell types, coupled with robust gene-level effect size estimation from GWAS, represents a critical future direction for illuminating the biological mechanisms underlying the results of large-scale genetic association studies.
