title: "Genome-wide association scans for secondary traits using case-control samples"
description: |
  * This statistical methodology paper examines the bias introduced when a **case-control GWAS** (designed for a primary disease $D$) is used to analyze a **secondary quantitative trait** ($T$).
  * It demonstrates that **naïve analysis** (ignoring case-control ascertainment) leads to **biased effect estimates** for the marker-secondary trait association ($G-T$) specifically when **both the marker $G$ and the trait $T$ are independently associated with the primary disease $D$**.
  * The authors propose using **Inverse-Probability-of-Sampling-Weighted (IPW) regression** as the robust method, which provides **unbiased estimates** in all scenarios, though at the cost of reduced statistical power, recommending naïve analysis for markers not associated with the primary disease.

## Key Findings

This paper addresses a critical methodological issue in genetic epidemiology where researchers attempt to maximize the return on investment from an expensive case-control **Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS)** by analyzing additional, or **secondary, quantitative traits** (e.g., body mass index, mammographic density) collected on the same subjects. The core finding is that a **naïve analysis** (ignoring the case-control ascertainment) can lead to **biased estimates** of the association between a genetic marker and the secondary trait, particularly when **both the marker and the secondary trait are independently associated with the primary disease risk**. The authors demonstrate that the use of **Inverse-Probability-of-Sampling-Weighted (IPW) regression** provides **unbiased estimates** of the marker-secondary trait association in all scenarios, although it may suffer from reduced statistical power compared to the biased naïve methods.

## Statistical Problem: Ascertainment Bias

Case-control studies are designed to test the association between a genetic marker and a primary binary disease (e.g., breast cancer). When using these same samples to study a quantitative trait (the secondary trait, e.g., mammographic density), the selection process (ascertainment) based on the disease status introduces a bias.

### Naïve Analysis Scenarios

The study mathematically and via simulation tested the performance of two "naïve" approaches for testing the association between a marker ($G$) and a secondary trait ($T$) using case-control data, where $D$ is the primary disease status:

1.  **Ignoring $D$**: Regressing $T$ on $G$ in the combined sample, ignoring case-control status.
2.  **Stratifying on $D$**: Regressing $T$ on $G$ separately within cases and controls, and then combining the results (e.g., via meta-analysis).

The paper shows that both naïve methods have:

* **Proper Type I Error Rates (Unbiased Test)**: When testing the null hypothesis of no $G-T$ association, the methods maintain the correct Type I error rate **unless** **both** $G$ and $T$ are independently associated with the primary disease $D$.
* **Unbiased Estimates (Under Alternative)**: Under the alternative hypothesis (i.e., a true $G-T$ association exists), the estimated effect size is **unbiased only if** the secondary trait $T$ is **not** associated with the primary disease $D$.

### Source of Bias

The bias in the naïve methods occurs when a significant confounding pathway exists: $G \rightarrow D \leftarrow T$. Since the case-control study non-randomly samples based on $D$, this selection distorts the observed association between $G$ and $T$.

## Solution: Inverse-Probability-of-Sampling Weighting (IPW)

The authors propose using **IPW regression** to correct for the ascertainment bias. IPW uses weights in the regression calculation that are inversely proportional to the probability of an individual being sampled into the study.

* The weights are calculated based on the sampling fractions of cases and controls.
* **Performance**: IPW regression yielded **unbiased estimates** of the $G-T$ association and maintained the **proper Type I error rate** in all scenarios considered, regardless of the association between $G$, $T$, and $D$.
* **Trade-off**: IPW regression consistently demonstrated **lower statistical power** than the naïve analyses in situations where the naïve analyses were also unbiased.

## Practical Recommendations

The study concludes with practical recommendations for GWAS analysis of secondary traits:

1.  **General Markers**: For the vast majority of markers tested in a GWAS (which are not associated with the primary disease $D$), the **naïve analyses are valid tests** of association and provide nearly unbiased estimates of the $G-T$ association.
2.  **Disease-Associated Markers**: **Care must be taken** when both the marker ($G$) and the secondary trait ($T$) are associated with the primary disease ($D$). In this scenario, the naïve estimates will be biased, and **IPW regression is the statistically valid method** to obtain an unbiased estimate of the $G-T$ effect.
3.  **Illustration**: The authors illustrate the potential for bias using an analysis of the relationship between a marker in the *FGFR2* gene (a known breast cancer risk locus) and mammographic density in a breast cancer case-control sample.
