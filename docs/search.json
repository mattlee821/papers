    "text": "Key Findings\nThis study introduces LS-imputation, a nonparametric method that uses GWAS summary statistics combined with individual-level genotypes to impute trait values, enabling nonlinear SNP-trait association analyses and machine learning applications that are impossible with summary statistics alone.\n\nMain Discoveries\n\nNovel imputation approach: First method to recover genetic components of traits from GWAS summary data for nonlinear association analysis\nPerfect recovery property: When test genotypes match training genotypes (X = X*), the method perfectly recovers (centered) trait values, capturing nonlinear SNP-trait information despite using only linear marginal associations\nSuperior performance for association analysis: LS-imputation outperforms state-of-the-art PRS method (PRS-CS) for subsequent association analyses under non-additive models and SNP-SNP interaction detection\nEnables new analyses: Makes possible three applications currently impossible with GWAS summary data: non-additive genetic models, SNP-SNP interaction detection, and nonlinear prediction models"

    "text": "Key Findings\nThis comprehensive review synthesizes the field’s understanding of genetic architecture—the characteristics of genetic variation responsible for heritable phenotypic variability—in the era following the advent of large-scale Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) and Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS). The authors systematically define the components of genetic architecture and explain how recent technological advances have begun to reveal the complex interplay of factors contributing to human traits and diseases.\n\nCore Components of Genetic Architecture\nThe genetic architecture of any complex trait is defined by four interacting components, which the review explores in depth:\n\nNumber of Causal Variants: The sheer count of genetic variants (SNPs, indels, SVs) that collectively affect the trait. Most complex traits are highly polygenic, involving thousands of variants.\nEffect Size Distribution: The magnitude of the effect that each variant contributes to the phenotype. GWAS has revealed that many common variants have small, additive effects, while rare variants often have large effects.\nAllele Frequency Spectrum: The distribution of causal variant frequencies in the population. Common traits are often influenced by variants across the entire frequency spectrum, supporting the ‘common disease, common variant’ and ‘common disease, rare variant’ hypotheses in tandem.\nInteractions: The complexity added by non-additive relationships:\n\nAllelic Interactions: Dominance (interaction between alleles at the same locus).\nLocus Interactions: Epistasis (interaction between alleles at different loci).\nEnvironmental Interactions: Gene-by-Environment (GxE) interaction."

    "section": "Impact of Modern Genomic Technologies on Architecture Discovery",
    "text": "Impact of Modern Genomic Technologies on Architecture Discovery\nThe review highlights how different technologies have been instrumental in characterizing specific aspects of the genetic architecture:\n\nGWAS and Common Variant Architecture\n\nGWAS Success: GWAS has been highly successful in identifying thousands of common, low-effect variants for hundreds of traits, confirming the extreme polygenicity of complex traits.\nMissing Heritability: The review addresses the historical problem of “missing heritability”—the gap between heritability estimated from twin/family studies (broad-sense heritability) and that explained by all detected common SNPs (SNP-heritability). Explanations include:\n\nThe contribution of rare variants missed by GWAS arrays.\nThe residual influence of non-additive effects (dominance and epistasis) captured by family studies but not fully by linear GWAS models.\nThe contribution of structural variation and gene-environment interactions.\n\nLocus Heterogeneity: GWAS often reveals multiple independent associated signals within the same locus, indicating allelic series or complex local regulation.\n\n\n\nNext-Generation Sequencing (NGS) and Rare Variants\n\nSequencing Role: NGS studies (e.g., whole-exome sequencing, whole-genome sequencing) are essential for characterizing the role of rare variants.\nBurden Tests: These tests aggregate the effects of multiple rare variants within a single gene or region. The review notes that rare, high-penetrance variants often reside in genes under strong negative selection, explaining why their overall contribution to population variance (though individually large) may be limited.\nClinical Relevance: Rare variants are crucial for understanding Mendelian disease and for identifying genes with large effects that are strong candidates for drug targets."

    "text": "Complexity of Genetic Effects\n\nPleiotropy and Shared Genetic Etiology\n\nWidespread Pleiotropy: The authors emphasize that pleiotropy (a single genetic variant affecting multiple distinct traits) is the norm, not the exception, for common variants identified by GWAS. This is supported by analyses showing extensive genetic correlation between traits.\nConfounding: Pleiotropy complicates causal inference. The review discusses how techniques like Mendelian Randomization (MR) are used to distinguish true causal effects from horizontal pleiotropy (a single variant affecting multiple outcomes through different pathways).\n\n\n\nGene-Environment (GxE) Interactions\n\nDefinition: GxE occurs when the effect of a genetic variant on a phenotype depends on the individual’s environment (e.g., diet, smoking, stress).\nDetection Challenge: GxE interactions are notoriously difficult to detect and estimate accurately due to requiring large samples with precise environmental measures. The review notes that population-based cohorts like the UK Biobank are vital for making progress in this area."

    "text": "Key Findings\nThis study performed a large-scale, cross-ancestry evaluation of Polygenic Risk Scores (PRSs) for four major common diseases—Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), Breast Cancer, and Prostate Cancer—using genome-wide genotype data from six biobanks across Europe, the United States, and Asia, encompassing over one million individuals. The principal finding is a striking disparity in PRS transferability and accuracy: the predictive ability of PRSs remains robust and highly similar across various European populations and local population substructures, suggesting utility in clinical settings for this group. However, the PRSs exhibited significantly poorer transferability and substantially lower effect sizes in individuals of African ancestry, and to a lesser extent, in South Asian and East Asian ancestries. This large-scale empirical evidence underscores the immediate challenge of ancestral bias in genomic data and highlights the potential for the clinical implementation of current PRSs to exacerbate existing health disparities."

The ancestries evaluated included European, South Asian, East Asian, and African.\n\nPRS Calculation and Evaluation\n\nPRS Method: Genome-wide PRSs were calculated using LDpred, a method that accounts for linkage disequilibrium (LD) and uses a Bayesian approach to estimate SNP effect sizes, incorporating over 6 million variants for each disease.\nInput Data: The input weights were obtained from the largest publicly available, non-overlapping Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWASs) for each of the four diseases.\nTransferability Assessment: Transferability was assessed by comparing the Odds Ratios (OR) per standard deviation (SD) increase in PRS across different global ancestry groups, and also within European populations (including a population isolate, Finland)."

For instance, in breast cancer, the association was not statistically significant in women of African ancestry in some cohorts.\n\n\n\nSubstructure and Polygenicity\n\nWithin-European Transferability: The PRSs transferred well even between highly structured European populations, such as various regional substructures within Finland, demonstrating robustness across recent population bottlenecks.\nGenome-wide vs. Sparse PRS: A crucial methodological finding was that the highly polygenic, genome-wide PRSs (using millions of variants) displayed higher effect sizes and better transferability across global ancestries than PRSs containing only a smaller, more stringently selected set of variants (sparse PRSs). This supports the notion that the polygenic nature of these traits is captured across different populations, even if the fine-mapping of causal variants differs."

The study stresses the urgent necessity of investing in and executing large-scale GWAS in non-European populations to address this bias."

    "text": "Genetic prediction of complex traits with polygenic scores: A statistical review\n\nThis statistical review comprehensively analyzes 46 methods for Polygenic Score (PGS) construction, unifying most of them under a multiple linear regression framework to clarify their assumptions regarding effect size distribution and Linkage Disequilibrium (LD).\nThe review concludes that optimal PGS performance (accuracy) is highly dependent on the trait’s genetic architecture and is significantly improved by using Bayesian/Regularization methods (e.g., LDpred, PRS-CS) that explicitly model LD and incorporate informed prior distributions for SNP effects.\nA critical challenge highlighted is the significant loss of transferability across ancestral populations, underscoring the need for more diverse training data and methods that better address ancestral heterogeneity and incorporate non-additive and Gene-by-Environment (GxE) effects.\n\n\n\nGenome-wide risk prediction of common diseases across ancestries in one million people\n\nThis large-scale study evaluated the cross-ancestry transferability of Polygenic Risk Scores (PRSs) for four common diseases (CAD, T2D, breast, and prostate cancer) using data from six biobanks and over one million individuals of diverse global ancestries.\nThe analysis found that PRS transferability was high and robust across different populations and substructures of European ancestry, but was significantly lower for individuals of African, South Asian, and East Asian ancestry.\nThe poor transferability, which was most pronounced in African ancestry individuals, highlights the critical issue of ancestral bias in genomic research and the potential for current PRS implementation to exacerbate health disparities until more diverse training data are available.\n\n\n\nPolygenic scoring accuracy varies across the genetic ancestry continuum\n\nCore Principle: This landmark study challenged the traditional use of discrete ancestry groups for polygenic scores (PGSs), proposing a framework that evaluates individual-level PGS accuracy based on Genetic Distance (GD) from the GWAS training population.\nKey Finding: They demonstrated that individual-level PGS accuracy experiences a continuous, steep decay as GD from the training data increases, with an average Pearson correlation of R = -0.95 across 84 complex traits, confirming that performance loss is a predictable function of genetic dissimilarity.\nHealth Equity Implication: The study quantified a major health disparity, showing that the genetically closest individuals of non-European ancestry (e.g., Hispanic/Latino American) had PGS accuracy comparable to the most distant European-ancestry individuals, highlighting the severe and systematic bias due to lack of diversity in training cohorts.\nRecommendation: The authors advocate for moving beyond discrete ancestry labels and using continuous metrics like GD to characterize and correct for performance disparities, thus ensuring more equitable clinical translation of PGSs."

The authors review 46 different methods for PGS construction, establishing a unifying multiple linear regression framework to connect and categorize the majority of these techniques. The core conclusion is that the optimal PGS method is highly dependent on the genetic architecture of the target trait (e.g., polygenicity, effect size distribution) and the nature of the available training and target data.

    "text": "Categorization and Statistical Framework\nThe review structures the diverse landscape of PGS methods into a coherent statistical framework, primarily centered on how they estimate the SNP effect sizes, which serve as the weights for the Polygenic Score.\n\nCore PGS Calculation\nIn its simplest form, the PGS for an individual (\\(i\\)) is a weighted sum of their genotypes across \\(M\\) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs): \\[\\text{PGS}_i = \\sum_{j=1}^{M} G_{ij} \\hat{\\beta}_j\\] where \\(G_{ij}\\) is the genotype of individual \\(i\\) at SNP \\(j\\), and \\(\\hat{\\beta}_j\\) is the estimated genetic effect size (the weight) for that SNP.\n\n\nUnifying Multiple Linear Regression Framework\nThe authors classify most modern PGS methods as variants of a general multiple linear regression model: \\[\\mathbf{Y} = \\mathbf{G}\\mathbf{\\beta} + \\mathbf{\\epsilon}\\] where \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\) is the phenotype vector, \\(\\mathbf{G}\\) is the genotype matrix, \\(\\mathbf{\\beta}\\) is the vector of true genetic effects, and \\(\\mathbf{\\epsilon}\\) is the error term. Different PGS methods (e.g., LDpred, S-Bayes) are distinguished by their assumptions about the effect size vector, \\(\\mathbf{\\beta}\\), and how they account for the correlation structure of the genotypes (Linkage Disequilibrium or LD).\n\n\nClassification of PGS Methods\nThe review categorizes the 46 analyzed methods based on their underlying statistical approach:\n\nClassical Methods: These include P-value Thresholding and Clumping (P+T), which selects a subset of independent SNPs based on their p-values. This remains a simple and surprisingly effective baseline method.\nBayesian and Regularization Methods: These methods explicitly model the genetic architecture by incorporating prior distributions on the SNP effect sizes (\\(\\mathbf{\\beta}\\)) and/or regularizing the estimates to account for noise and LD. Examples include:\n\nLDpred/LDpred2: Assumes a fraction of SNPs are causal and uses an LD reference panel to shrink effect sizes.\nBayesC/BayesR: Assumes effect sizes come from a mixture of normal distributions, allowing for a few large effects and many small ones.\nLasso/Ridge Regression: Uses penalization to optimize effect size selection and estimation.\n\nSummary Statistics-Based Methods: Methods that operate entirely on GWAS summary statistics and an external LD reference panel (e.g., LDpred, S-Bayes, PRS-CS). These are the most computationally efficient and widely used due to data sharing conventions.\nMeta-Dimensional Methods: These include methods that incorporate information beyond SNP effects, such as functional annotations or gene expression data (e.g., MetaXcan)."

Bayesian methods often excel because they flexibly model the prior distribution of effect sizes.\nTraining Sample Size: Performance is highly dependent on the size of the GWAS used to estimate \\(\\hat{\\beta}\\). Larger sample sizes generally lead to more accurate effect size estimates and thus better PGS performance.\nAncestral Divergence: Prediction accuracy significantly drops when the target population ancestry differs substantially from the training population (e.g., GWAS conducted primarily in European populations but applied to African populations). This highlights the critical issue of transferability and health equity.\nLinkage Disequilibrium (LD) Modeling: Explicitly accounting for LD, such as in LDpred and PRS-CS, is crucial for improving prediction accuracy compared to simple methods like P+T.\n\n\n\nDecision Tree for PGS Analysis\nThe review provides a practical decision tree to help researchers select the appropriate PGS method based on the available data and research question:\nKey branches include: * Input Data: Is individual-level data or only GWAS summary data available? * Trait Complexity: Analyzing a single trait or multiple correlated traits? * Modeling Approach: Choosing between model-based (e.g., linear mixed models) and algorithm-based (e.g., machine learning) methods."

    "text": "Key Findings: The Genetic Distance Penalty on PGS Accuracy\nThis study provides a critical, individual-level assessment of Polygenic Score (PGS) portability, which is necessary for the equitable clinical application of genetic risk prediction. The authors argue that assessing PGS performance using traditional discrete genetic ancestry clusters (e.g., European, African) obscures crucial inter-individual variation and biases estimates. They introduce a framework that evaluates accuracy along a genetic ancestry continuum using a precise metric: Genetic Distance (GD).\n\nCore Discovery: Continuous and Steep Decay of Accuracy\nThe central finding is the demonstration that PGS accuracy decreases individual-to-individual along the continuum of genetic ancestries in a highly predictable, linear fashion .\n\nMetric Definition: Genetic Distance (GD) is defined as the distance of a target individual’s genotype (e.g., PCA projection) from the population used to train the PGS model. The higher the GD, the more genetically dissimilar the individual is from the training set.\nQuantification of Decay: Across a large set of 84 complex traits and diseases, the average individual-level PGS accuracy showed an extremely powerful negative correlation with GD, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of -0.95. This near-perfect correlation highlights that the individual’s genetic background relative to the training population is the primary determinant of score performance.\nUbiquity of Variation: This decreasing trend was observed in all populations considered, including within traditionally labeled ‘homogeneous’ genetic ancestry groups (e.g., European ancestry in UK Biobank). This shows that sub-ancestry variation within a single continent still results in a measurable loss of accuracy based on GD.\n\n\n\nDemonstrating Inequity and Systematic Bias\nThe study leveraged data from the UK Biobank (UKBB, training set, predominantly White British) and the diverse Los Angeles biobank (ATLAS, testing set) to quantify the transferability gap.\n\nIntra-European Penalty: When applying UKBB-trained models to individuals of European ancestry in ATLAS, those in the furthest GD decile experienced a significant 14% lower accuracy relative to those in the closest decile.\nCross-Ancestry Disparity: The results reveal a severe “distance penalty” for non-European groups. Individuals of Hispanic/Latino American ancestry who are genetically closest (lowest GD decile) to the training data showed similar PGS performance to the European-ancestry individuals who are furthest away (highest GD decile). For the most distant Hispanic/Latino individuals, accuracy was substantially lower, overlapping with that of African American participants.\nBias in Risk Estimates: Crucially, GD was found to be significantly correlated with the PGS estimates themselves for 82 of 84 traits. This means the systematic bias due to ancestry distance does not just affect the accuracy (\\(R^2\\)) but also the magnitude of the predicted risk, potentially leading to widespread miscalibration and inequitable risk stratification.\n\n\n\nConclusion and Call to Action\nThe authors conclude that relying on aggregate population-level metrics (\\(\\text{e.g., } R^2\\)) obscures this vital individual-level variation and hinders efforts toward health equity. They urge researchers to abandon the use of discrete genetic ancestry clusters in favor of continuous metrics (like GD) to better characterize and address performance disparities, ensuring more reliable and equitable application of PGSs in personalized medicine."

Why GWAS Capture Pleiotropic Genes\nGWAS prioritize trait-specific variants, which can arise in two ways:\n\nVariants affecting trait-specific genes\nContext-specific variants on pleiotropic genes (e.g., tissue-specific regulatory variants)\n\nThe study found: - Variants in tissue-specific ATAC peaks show higher heritability enrichment - Coding variants in specifically expressed genes contribute more to heritability - This explains why GWAS can identify highly pleiotropic genes missed by burden tests\n\n\n4.

This happens because conditioning on the covariate (the collider) opens a spurious path between the SNP and unobserved confounders, which can lead to false positive associations with the primary outcome.\nUnbiased Estimation Condition: The resulting adjusted effect, \\(\\beta_{G \\rightarrow Y \\mid C}\\), accurately estimates the direct genetic effect on the outcome only under two strict causal models:\n\nThe SNP has no effect on the covariate (\\(\\beta_{G \\rightarrow C} = 0\\)).\nThe covariate (\\(C\\)) is a pure mediator, where the correlation between \\(C\\) and \\(Y\\) is entirely explained by a direct causal effect of \\(C\\) on \\(Y\\).\n\nBias Formula: For scenarios involving shared genetic or environmental risk factors, the bias (\\(\\text{Bias}\\)) in the adjusted genetic effect estimate is well-approximated by the equation: \\[\\text{Bias} \\approx -\\beta_{G \\rightarrow C} \\cdot \\rho_{C Y} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{\\text{Var}(C)}{\\text{Var}(Y)}}\\] Where \\(\\beta_{G \\rightarrow C}\\) is the genetic effect on the covariate, and \\(\\rho_{C Y}\\) is the phenotypic correlation between the covariate and the outcome.

This is achieved by adjusting for all causal factors of the covariate.\nLinear Regression Model: The estimation was performed using a standard linear regression: \\(Y = \\alpha + \\beta_{G \\rightarrow Y \\mid C} G + \\gamma C + \\epsilon\\). The authors derived the expected value of the adjusted coefficient, \\(\\mathbb{E}[\\beta_{G \\rightarrow Y \\mid C}]\\), showing that it equals the true direct effect plus the bias term under various causal scenarios.\nBias Derivation: The bias was derived by considering the correlation structure induced when the covariate and the outcome share unobserved causes, specifically showing how adjustment for \\(C\\) introduces conditioning on a collider related to the SNP’s effect. The full mathematical expression for the bias was derived, from which the simplified approximation was obtained.\n\n\n\nSimulation Methods\n\nScenarios Tested: Simulations covered all three major causal scenarios: C is a mediator of the effect of \\(G\\) on \\(Y\\); Y is a mediator of the effect of \\(G\\) on \\(C\\); and \\(G\\) is a shared cause (pleiotropy) where the effect of \\(G\\) on \\(Y\\) is mediated by \\(C\\), or the traits share a hidden common environmental cause (\\(U\\)).\nParameters: Simulations varied key parameters, including heritability of the traits (up to \\(h^2 = 0.5\\)), the phenotypic correlation (\\(\\rho_{C Y}\\), up to \\(0.5\\)), and the genetic effect sizes (\\(\\beta_G\\)).\nEvaluation Metrics: The primary metrics used to evaluate the consequences of the bias were the Type I error rate (false positive rate) and the statistical power of the adjusted association test. Results showed Type I error inflation when the adjusted model was used in biased scenarios.\n\n\n\nReal-World Data Application\n\nData Source: GWAS summary statistics from the GIANT consortium meta-analysis of anthropometric traits were used, specifically:\n\nGWAS of Waist-to-Hip Ratio (WHR) adjusted for BMI (\\(Y \\mid C\\)).\nGWAS of BMI (\\(C\\)).\n\nEmpirical Test: A test was performed to look for an enrichment of SNPs with marginal effects in opposite directions on WHR and BMI. A highly significant enrichment (\\(p=0.005\\)) was found, providing empirical evidence that the statistical bias was present and inflating the number of significant loci."

This effect explains the increased detection of specific loci in the WHR adjusted for BMI GWAS.\nInterpretation Challenge: Since the adjusted estimates reflect a combination of the true direct effect and the bias term, they are neither the total genetic effect nor the direct genetic effect in most scenarios involving shared genetic or environmental risk factors.\nRelevance to Ratio Traits: The findings are directly relevant to analyses of ratio traits (e.g., WHR, fasting glucose/insulin ratios), as these are mathematically equivalent to performing a regression adjusted for the denominator."

    "text": "Key Findings\nThis paper addresses a critical methodological issue in genetic epidemiology where researchers attempt to maximize the return on investment from an expensive case-control Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) by analyzing additional, or secondary, quantitative traits (e.g., body mass index, mammographic density) collected on the same subjects. The core finding is that a naïve analysis (ignoring the case-control ascertainment) can lead to biased estimates of the association between a genetic marker and the secondary trait, particularly when both the marker and the secondary trait are independently associated with the primary disease risk. The authors demonstrate that the use of Inverse-Probability-of-Sampling-Weighted (IPW) regression provides unbiased estimates of the marker-secondary trait association in all scenarios, although it may suffer from reduced statistical power compared to the biased naïve methods."

    "text": "Statistical Problem: Ascertainment Bias\nCase-control studies are designed to test the association between a genetic marker and a primary binary disease (e.g., breast cancer). When using these same samples to study a quantitative trait (the secondary trait, e.g., mammographic density), the selection process (ascertainment) based on the disease status introduces a bias.\n\nNaïve Analysis Scenarios\nThe study mathematically and via simulation tested the performance of two “naïve” approaches for testing the association between a marker (\\(G\\)) and a secondary trait (\\(T\\)) using case-control data, where \\(D\\) is the primary disease status:\n\nIgnoring \\(D\\): Regressing \\(T\\) on \\(G\\) in the combined sample, ignoring case-control status.\nStratifying on \\(D\\): Regressing \\(T\\) on \\(G\\) separately within cases and controls, and then combining the results (e.g., via meta-analysis).\n\nThe paper shows that both naïve methods have:\n\nProper Type I Error Rates (Unbiased Test): When testing the null hypothesis of no \\(G-T\\) association, the methods maintain the correct Type I error rate unless both \\(G\\) and \\(T\\) are independently associated with the primary disease \\(D\\).\nUnbiased Estimates (Under Alternative): Under the alternative hypothesis (i.e., a true \\(G-T\\) association exists), the estimated effect size is unbiased only if the secondary trait \\(T\\) is not associated with the primary disease \\(D\\).\n\n\n\nSource of Bias\nThe bias in the naïve methods occurs when a significant confounding pathway exists: \\(G \\rightarrow D \\leftarrow T\\). Since the case-control study non-randomly samples based on \\(D\\), this selection distorts the observed association between \\(G\\) and \\(T\\)."

In this scenario, the naïve estimates will be biased, and IPW regression is the statistically valid method to obtain an unbiased estimate of the \\(G-T\\) effect.\nIllustration: The authors illustrate the potential for bias using an analysis of the relationship between a marker in the FGFR2 gene (a known breast cancer risk locus) and mammographic density in a breast cancer case-control sample."
