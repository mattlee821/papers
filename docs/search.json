    "text": "Key Findings\nThis study provides a systematic comparison of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and rare variant loss-of-function (LoF) burden tests, revealing fundamental differences in how these methods prioritize genes.\n\nMain Discoveries\n\nDifferent Gene Rankings: GWAS and LoF burden tests systematically prioritize different genes, even when accounting for power differences and gene-mapping issues\nTrait Specificity vs. Importance:\n\nBurden tests prioritize trait-specific genes (genes primarily affecting the studied trait)\nGWAS prioritize trait-specific variants (which can act on pleiotropic genes through context-specific effects)\n\nThree Key Factors:\n\nSpecificity: How specific a gene/variant’s effects are to the trait under study\nLength: Longer genes are more likely to be discovered by burden tests due to more LoF sites\nLuck: Random genetic drift causes variant frequencies to vary, making GWAS rankings partially stochastic"

    "section": "Major Results",
    "text": "Major Results\n\n1. Discordant Gene Rankings\n\nOnly 26% of burden test hits fall within top GWAS loci\n74.6% of burden hits are within any GWAS locus, but often ranked much lower\nExample: NPR2 is the 2nd most significant burden test gene for height but contained in the 243rd most significant GWAS locus\n\n\n\n2. Why Burden Tests Prioritize Trait-Specific Genes\nBurden tests aggregate LoF variants within genes. The expected association strength is proportional to:\n\\[\\frac{\\gamma_1^2}{\\sum_t \\gamma_t^2}\\]\nwhere \\(\\gamma_1^2\\) is the gene’s effect on the studied trait and \\(\\sum_t \\gamma_t^2\\) is its total effect across all traits.\nKey mechanisms: - Natural selection acts more strongly on genes with larger total effects across traits - This keeps LoF frequencies lower for pleiotropic genes - Result: Trait-specific genes have more power in burden tests despite potentially smaller effects\n\n\n3. Why GWAS Capture Pleiotropic Genes\nGWAS prioritize trait-specific variants, which can arise in two ways:\n\nVariants affecting trait-specific genes\nContext-specific variants on pleiotropic genes (e.g., tissue-specific regulatory variants)\n\nThe study found: - Variants in tissue-specific ATAC peaks show higher heritability enrichment - Coding variants in specifically expressed genes contribute more to heritability - This explains why GWAS can identify highly pleiotropic genes missed by burden tests\n\n\n4. Gene Length Bias in Burden Tests\n\nLonger genes have more potential LoF sites\nThis increases LoF carrier frequency, boosting statistical power\nEffect: Longer genes appear more significant and more pleiotropic, independent of their true biological importance\n\n\n\n5. The Role of Genetic Drift in GWAS\n\nRandom drift causes variant frequencies to vary widely around their expected values\nFor sufficiently important variants, GWAS rankings become largely random with respect to true effect size\nHigh-frequency variants have more power, creating an apparent “pleiotropy” of top GWAS hits (statistical artifact)"

    "text": "Biological Implications\n\nContext-Specific Variants\nThe finding that many GWAS loci lack burden signals suggests context-specific variants acting on pleiotropic genes are major drivers of complex traits. The authors hypothesize these may include: - Developmental genes - Variants that perturb developmental trajectories in trait-specific ways - Tissue-specific regulatory elements\n\n\nDrug Target Discovery\n\nTrait-specific genes (identified by burden tests) may be better drug targets due to fewer side effects\nExplains why LoF burden evidence is more predictive of drug trial success than GWAS evidence\nHowever, if pleiotropic genes can be targeted context-specifically, they may have greater clinical impact"

The choice of method depends on the research question and application, with burden tests better for identifying specific biology and GWAS better for comprehensive discovery including pleiotropic mechanisms."
