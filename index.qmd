title: "Research Papers Overview"
---

A centralized repository for research paper summaries and methodology notes across various omics and statistical genetics fields.

## Categories

- **Genetics**: GWAS, fine-mapping, heritability, complex trait architecture, and population genetics.
- **Mendelian Randomization (MR)**: methods, assumptions, bias correction (collider, pleiotropy), and tissue-specific applications.
- **Proteomics**: pQTL analysis, biomarker discovery, and protein-phenotype associations across human diseases and aging.
- **Metabolomics**: metabolic reprogramming, lipidomics, and data processing.
- **Multi-omics**: data integration (transcriptomics, proteomics), latent variable models, and machine learning for predictive modeling.
- **Finemap & Colocalisation**: Bayesian and frequentist methods for resolving association signals and colocalizing traits.
- **Expression**: bulk and single-cell RNA-seq, spatial transcriptomics, and gene signature discovery in cancer genomics.
- **PGS**: polygenic scores, ancestry transferability, disease subtyping, and functional genomics integration.
- **Statistics**: causal diagrams (DAGs), survival analysis, p-value interpretation, and trial design.
- **Interaction**: gene-environment (GxE) interactions, variance component methods, and polygenic trait analysis.
- **ML**: Bayesian kernel machine regression and nonparametric models for environmental health and multi-pollutant mixtures.
- **Cancer**: immunogenomics, targeted therapy, survival analysis, and deep learning for pan-cancer molecular subtyping.
- **Other**: Miscellaneous research summaries and general project notes.

## Project Structure

This site uses Quarto's **Listings** feature to automatically organize papers by category. Use the navigation bar or the sidebars in each section to explore the summaries.
