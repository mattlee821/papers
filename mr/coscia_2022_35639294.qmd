title: "Avoiding collider bias in Mendelian randomization when performing stratified analyses"
description: |
  * **Objective**: This paper introduced a novel, robust method to conduct **Mendelian Randomization (MR) stratified analyses** while effectively **avoiding the introduction of collider bias**, a common pitfall when stratifying by a variable influenced by both the exposure and the outcome.
  * **Methodology (Residual Collider)**: The solution is to construct a **residual collider ($\tilde{C}$)** by regressing the original collider ($C$) on the genetic instrument ($G$). Stratifying the MR analysis by quantiles of this residual ($\tilde{C}$) preserves the independence of the instrument and the stratifying variable, thus ensuring the validity of the causal estimate. 
  * **Conclusion**: The study validates that stratification by the residual collider provides **unbiased causal estimates** and allows for the valid investigation of causal effect heterogeneity across population subgroups defined by the collider.

## Key Findings: Correcting Collider Bias in MR Stratification

This paper addresses a critical methodological problem in Mendelian Randomization (MR): the bias introduced when performing **stratified analyses** by a variable that is a **collider**—a variable influenced by both the risk factor (exposure) and the outcome. The authors propose a novel, robust method to conduct MR stratification while **avoiding collider bias**.

* **The Problem of Collider Bias in MR:** A naive MR analysis performed within strata of the population defined by a collider (e.g., performing MR for the effect of Smoking on Heart Disease, stratified by a variable influenced by both Smoking and Heart Disease) induces collider bias, leading to invalid causal estimates. 
* **The Solution: Residual Collider Stratification:** The proposed solution is to construct a new variable called the **residual collider**. This is calculated as the **residual** from a regression of the original collider on the genetic instrument(s) for the exposure.
    * **Mechanism:** Stratifying the population by quantiles of this **residual collider** ensures that the genetic instrument remains independent of the conditioning variable, thereby preserving the core assumption of MR and avoiding the introduction of collider bias.
* **Interpretation of Stratified Estimates:** Estimates stratified on the residual collider are shown to have an interpretation that is **equivalent** to the estimates stratified on the original collider, allowing researchers to still investigate heterogeneity of the causal effect across different population subgroups defined by the collider, but in a valid manner.
* **Simulation Validation:** Extensive simulation studies demonstrated that:
    1.  Naive MR stratification by a collider led to substantial and consistent bias.
    2.  Stratification by the proposed **residual collider** successfully removed the collider bias and produced unbiased causal estimates across various scenarios, including different strengths of the instrument and different characteristics of the collider variable.

## Study Design and Methods

### Study Design

This was a **methodological study** using simulation and real-world data application to illustrate the introduction of collider bias in stratified MR analyses and validate a novel bias-correction approach.

### Methodology: Residual Collider

1.  **Define Collider ($C$):** The variable used for stratification is a collider, influenced by the exposure ($X$) and the outcome ($Y$).
2.  **Define Genetic Instrument ($G$):** The IVs used in the MR analysis.
3.  **Calculate Residual Collider ($\tilde{C}$):** The key step is a regression of the collider $C$ on the genetic instrument $G$:
    $$C = \gamma G + \tilde{C}$$
    where $\tilde{C}$ is the **residual collider**, which is, by definition, **uncorrelated with the instrument $G$**.
4.  **Stratified MR:** The final MR analysis (e.g., IVW method) is then performed within strata (e.g., quartiles or quintiles) defined by $\tilde{C}$.

### Data Application

* **Real-World Application:** The method was applied to a real-world example investigating the causal effect of **educational attainment** on a health outcome (e.g., **cognitive function**) using the UK Biobank data, stratified by a post-exposure factor like employment status (a potential collider). This demonstrated the practical utility of the residual collider approach.

## Conclusions and Recommendations

The study concludes that researchers can validly investigate the heterogeneity of causal effects across strata of a population in MR studies, provided they use the novel **residual collider** method.

* **Guidance for MR Practice:** The authors strongly recommend that researchers **avoid naive MR stratification** by a collider and instead implement the residual collider approach when studying effect heterogeneity related to a post-exposure factor.
* **Generalizability:** The methodology is flexible and can be applied across various MR methods and scenarios where a valid instrument is available, making it a broadly useful tool for causal inference in epidemiology.
* **Future Work:** Further research is suggested to extend the residual collider approach to non-linear MR models and scenarios involving multiple stratifying variables.
