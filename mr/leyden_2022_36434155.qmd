title: "Disentangling the aetiological pathways between body mass index and site-specific cancer risk using tissue-partitioned Mendelian randomisation"
description: |
  * **Objective**: This study used **tissue-partitioned Mendelian randomization (MR)** to separate the genetic effects of BMI into **brain-mediated (appetite)** and **adipose-mediated (metabolic)** pathways to assess their independent causal impact on seven site-specific cancer risks.
  * **Key Finding (Lung Cancer)**: The **brain-mediated BMI variants** were identified as the predominant causal driver of **lung cancer** risk (OR: 1.17), an effect which was shown to be highly correlated with an increase in **cigarettes per day**, suggesting a shared genetic mechanism acting via addictive behaviors.
  * **Key Finding (Colorectal Cancer)**: A non-significant trend suggested that the **adipose-mediated BMI variants** were more strongly associated with **colorectal cancer** risk, supporting the role of metabolic consequences of adiposity in this disease.

## Key Findings: Tissue-Specific BMI Effects on Cancer

This study applied **tissue-partitioned Mendelian randomization (MR)** to separate the genetic effects of BMI mediated by **subcutaneous adipose tissue (metabolic)** from those mediated by **brain tissue (appetite/central regulation)** and assessed their differential causal impact on the risk of seven site-specific cancers.

* **Brain-Mediated BMI Drives Lung Cancer Risk:** The most distinct finding was that the **brain-tissue-derived BMI variants** were the predominant driver of the genetically predicted causal effect of BMI on **lung cancer** risk (OR: 1.17; 95% CI: 1.01-1.36).
    * This effect was strongly supported by a parallel finding: the brain-mediated BMI variants were also robustly associated with an increased number of **cigarettes per day** (Beta = 0.44; 95% CI: 0.26-0.61). This suggests that the genetic pathway influencing BMI via appetite/central regulation may increase lung cancer risk primarily by promoting addictive behaviors (smoking).
* **Adipose-Mediated BMI Drives Colorectal Cancer Risk (Marginal Evidence):** The **adipose-tissue-derived BMI variants** showed a stronger, though non-significant at the conventional level, association with **colorectal cancer** risk (OR: 1.07; 95% CI: 0.99-1.15). This suggests that the metabolic consequences of excess adipose tissue are the more relevant pathway for this cancer type.
* **No Distinct Partitioned Effects on Other Cancers:** For the remaining five site-specific cancers investigated (breast, prostate, kidney, ovarian, and endometrial), the causal effects of the brain-mediated and adipose-mediated BMI partitions were **statistically indistinguishable**. This suggests that either the downstream cancer mechanisms are shared, or the current tissue partitioning is insufficient to separate the relevant pathways for these cancers.

## Study Design and Methods

### Study Design

This was a **two-sample tissue-partitioned Mendelian randomization (MR) study**. The methodology leveraged tissue-specific gene expression data to define two distinct sets of genetic instrumental variables (IVs) for BMI, allowing for the comparison of their independent causal effects on cancer risk.

### Data and Genetic Instrument Selection

1.  **Exposure GWAS (BMI):** Summary statistics were used from a large-scale BMI GWAS (GIANT consortium, $n \sim 322,000$).
2.  **Tissue-Specific Prioritization:** The study used a previously developed method to partition BMI IVs based on colocalization with gene expression (eQTLs) in two relevant tissues:
    * **Subcutaneous Adipose Tissue:** Used to proxy **metabolic/peripheral** mechanisms.
    * **Brain Tissue:** Used to proxy **appetite/central regulation** mechanisms.
3.  **Instrument Sets:** This resulted in two, largely non-overlapping sets of IVs: the **adipose-mediated set** and the **brain-mediated set**.
4.  **Outcome GWAS Data (Cancers):** Outcome data were sourced from large international consortia GWAS for seven site-specific cancers: lung, colorectal, breast, prostate, kidney, ovarian, and endometrial cancers. Data for **Cigarettes per day (CPD)** were also used as an intermediate outcome to test the smoking pathway hypothesis.

### Statistical Analysis

* **MR Methodology:** A **Multivariable Mendelian Randomization (MVMR)** approach was applied. This method simultaneously models the effects of the brain-mediated and adipose-mediated BMI partitions, which helps to account for the correlation between the two instrumental variable sets, thereby providing the independent causal effect of each pathway.
* **Primary MR Method:** The MVMR estimates were derived and the results were reported as Odds Ratios (ORs) per one standard deviation (SD) increase in BMI for each pathway.
* **Sensitivity Analyses:** Standard MR sensitivity analyses (e.g., MR-Egger) were applied to the aggregated BMI instrument set to ensure overall robustness.

## Conclusions and Recommendations

The study successfully demonstrates that the complex genetic effects of BMI can be dissected into biologically meaningful pathways that have **distinct, site-specific causal consequences for cancer risk**.

* **Specific Aetiology for Lung Cancer:** The strong evidence linking the brain-mediated/appetite pathway to lung cancer risk, mediated by smoking behavior, provides a specific mechanistic target for prevention. Interventions should focus on the **behavioral and neurobiological aspects of appetite and addiction** in individuals with high genetic risk for this pathway.
* **Colorectal Cancer Focus:** The trend toward the adipose-mediated pathway driving colorectal cancer risk supports the traditional hypothesis that this cancer type is linked to the **metabolic and inflammatory consequences of excess adiposity**.
* **Future Directions:** The authors suggest that future studies should investigate whether the differential pathways identified for T2DM (previously shown to be brain-mediated) and CAD (shown to be similarly affected by both pathways) could also inform cancer risk mechanisms, further linking cardiometabolic and oncologic outcomes.
