title: "Exploring public cancer gene expression signatures across bulk, single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data with signifinder Bioconductor package"
description: |
  * **Problem**: Gene expression signatures (GESs) derived from **bulk RNA-Seq** often show inconsistent performance when applied to **single-cell (scRNA-Seq)** or **spatial transcriptomics (ST)** data due to differences in data sparsity and resolution.
  * **Solution**: The study introduces the **signifinder** Bioconductor package, a workflow that standardizes the testing and scoring of GESs across bulk, scRNA-Seq (using methods like AUCell), and ST platforms.
  * **Findings**: Application to breast cancer signatures revealed that only a small subset were highly **robust** across all three modalities. The package successfully mapped expression signatures to **spatial tissue regions**, enabling a more precise, high-resolution analysis of the **tumor microenvironment (TME)**.

## Core Problem and Study Goal

The vast and growing collection of published **gene expression signatures** (GESs)—lists of genes whose expression collectively characterizes a specific biological state, such as a cancer subtype or prognosis—are often derived from **bulk RNA-Seq** data. Modern transcriptomic studies increasingly rely on high-resolution methods like **single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq)** and **Spatial Transcriptomics (ST)**. The challenge is that these bulk-derived signatures often fail to perform consistently or effectively when directly applied to the noisier, higher-resolution data.

This study introduces the **signifinder** Bioconductor package, a comprehensive computational workflow designed to allow researchers to effectively investigate the behavior and robustness of known GESs across **bulk, single-cell, and spatial transcriptomics** data types.

## Methods: The signifinder Bioconductor Package

The **signifinder** package provides a streamlined workflow implemented in **R** for the re-analysis and comparison of gene expression signatures.

### 1. Signature Collection and Input
* **Input:** The package accepts user-defined GESs or a large compendium of over 100 publicly available, manually curated **breast cancer (BC)** signatures, allowing for standardized testing.
* **Data Handling:** It handles transcriptomic data from various sources (e.g., TCGA, GEO) and formats, including count and normalized data for bulk, scRNA-Seq, and ST.

### 2. Signature Scoring and Analysis
The package integrates multiple popular scoring methods, making it flexible for cross-platform comparison:
* **Bulk Data:** Uses standard methods like **Z-scores** and **GSVA (Gene Set Variation Analysis)**.
* **Single-Cell/Spatial Data:** Integrates specialized methods designed for sparse data, such as **AUCell** and **singscore**.

### 3. Visualization and Interpretation
The workflow provides structured output and visualization tools to interpret the results, including:
* **Robustness Metrics:** Quantification of how consistently a signature identifies specific sample groups across different platforms.
* **Feature Visualization:** Maps of signature scores onto spatial transcriptomics images to visualize the physical location of the cell states predicted by the signature.

## Key Findings: Application to Breast Cancer Signatures

The authors applied **signifinder** to investigate the robustness of 106 published breast cancer GESs across three different data modalities:

### 1. Robustness Across Modalities
* **Consistent Signatures:** Only a small subset of the tested signatures showed high robustness across all three data types (bulk, scRNA-Seq, ST).
* **High-Resolution Data Value:** The analysis revealed that some signatures that performed well in bulk data lost their predictive power in scRNA-Seq or ST, highlighting the need to re-validate bulk-derived signatures in high-resolution contexts.
* **Example:** Signatures based on **Proliferation** and **Basal/Claudin-low** subtypes were among the most robust, consistently classifying cell populations across technologies.

### 2. Deconvoluting the Tumor Microenvironment (TME)
Using **signifinder** on spatial transcriptomics data (e.g., from Visium), the authors demonstrated the package's ability to:
* **Locate Signatures:** Accurately map the spatial enrichment of signatures associated with different cell populations (e.g., immune cells, fibroblasts) and cancer features (e.g., proliferation) within the breast tumor tissue.
* **TME Characterization:** This capability allows researchers to refine the understanding of how the tumor microenvironment influences gene expression patterns, which is often masked in bulk sequencing.

## Conclusions and Recommendations

The **signifinder** Bioconductor package addresses a critical need in computational cancer biology by providing a standardized, reproducible, and flexible tool for assessing the performance of gene expression signatures across emerging high-resolution transcriptomics platforms. The authors recommend that researchers use such methods to validate the relevance and consistency of their signatures when moving between bulk and single-cell/spatial data, ensuring reliable translation of findings.
